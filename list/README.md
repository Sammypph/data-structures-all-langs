## Introduction
A List is a data structure that is used to store elements. In languages like Java, all elements in a list need to be of the same type, however, in other languages like Ruby, elements of different types can be in the same list. What's special about a List is the flexibility it provides. Some common operations include:
* `add(e)`: insert item **e** at the end of the list
* `add(n, e)`: insert item **e** at index **n**
* `remove(n)`: remove the item at index **n**
* `get(n)`: get the item at position **n**
* `sort()`: sort the items in the list
* `slice(start, end)`: return a sub-list slice starting at the position start up until the position end
* `reverse()`: reverse the order of the list <sup>[1](https://github.com/oyekanmiayo/data-structures-all-langs/tree/add-list-impl/list#references)</sup>

###### PS: Operations can be named differently in different languages

## Internals
An **array** is the underlying data structure used by a List. One important difference between a List and an array is that a List does not have a fixed size - what this really means is that anytime the underlying array of a List instance is about to get filled, all the items are copied to a bigger array in an abstracted way.

How does inserting at item (`add(e)`) in a list work?
1. Check if the underlying array is filled
2. If it is not,
    * insert element **e** in the next available index in the array
3. If it is,
    * copy all elements in the current underlying array to a bigger array
    * insert element **e** in the next available index in the new, bigger array

How does inserting an item at an index (`add(n, e)`) in a list work?
1. Check if the underlying array is filled
2. If it is, copy all elements in the current underlying array to a bigger array
3. Move elements from index **n** forward by one index
4. Insert element **e** at index **n**

###### PS: This is an opinionated implementation. It might be implemented differently depending on the programming language you use.

How does removing an item (`remove(n)`) from a list work?
1. Remove reference to item by setting index **n** to null
2. Move elements from index **n+1** to the end backward by one index

How does retrieving an item (`get(n)`) from a list work?
1. Check if index exists, if it doesn't, throws an IndexOutOfBoundsException
2. Return element at index **n**

How does sorting (`sort()`) a list work?
1. Sort elements in ascending or descending order
*If the elements are complex objects, the are sorted based on custom comparators*

How does retrieving a sublist (`slice(start, end)`) from a list work?
1. Create a new list that is the size of the slice being requested
2. Insert all elements from start to end in existing list to new list

How does reversing the order (`reverse()`) of a list work?
1. Reverse elements in the underlying array 

## Time Complexity
Time Complexities for operations mentioned [here](https://github.com/oyekanmiayo/data-structures-all-langs/tree/main/list#introduction). We consider the worst cases.

* `add(e)`: time to copy items to new array, if current array is filled + time to insert item into index
   | Time to copy items to new array | Time to insert item into index | Worst Case for `add(e)` |
   |---------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------|
   | Linear Time/O(N)                | Constant Time/O(1)             | Linear Time/O(N)        |
   
* `add(n, e)`: time to copy items to new array, if current array is filled + time to move items forward by one index + time to insert item into index
   | Time to copy items to new array | Time to move items forward by one index | Time to insert item into index | Worst Case for `add(n,e)` |
   |---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------|
   | Linear Time/O(N)                | Linear Time/O(N)                        | Constant Time/O(1)             | Linear Time/O(N)          |

   | Time to remove reference to item at index | Time to move items backward by one index | Worst Case for `remove(n)` |

   | Time to retrieve item from an index | Worst Case for `get(n)` |
   |-------------------------------------|-------------------------|
   | Constant Time/O(1)                  | Constant Time/O(1)      |
   
* `sort()`: time to sort items in ascending/descending order, using the most efficient sorting algorithms
   | Time to sort items using most efficient algorithms | Worst Case for `sort()`    |

* `slice(start, end)`: time to traverse original list + time to insert sliced items into new list
   | Time to traverse list | Time to insert sliced items into list                                       | Worst Case for `slice(start, end)` |
   |-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
   | Linear Time/O(N)      | Linear Time/O(K), K = size of slice. K can be equal to N in the worst case. | Linear Time/O(N)                   |
   
* `reverse()`: time to reverse elements in the underlying array 
   | Time to reverse elements in array | Worst Case for `reverse()` |

   | Linear Time/O(N)                  | Linear Time/O(N)           |

## Other Definitions
* **Comparator**: In electronics, a comparator is a device that compares two voltages or currents and outputs a digital signal indicating which is larger (Read more [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparator)). This works in a similar way in programming: a comparator is a function that compares two objects and outputs a integer indicating which is larger.
